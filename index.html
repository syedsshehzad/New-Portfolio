		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<img src="./assets/images/profilepic.jpg" class="pp" alt="Sahir">
		<p>The three types of work I really enjoy doing are the ones in which: (1) I solve interesting challenges, (2) I get to be creative, and (3) I can see the satisfaction of others with my work, so web development has become my passion.</p>
		<p>I started my web development experience at the University of Richmond, in the coding boot camp. It is where I began learning web development in detail, and by the end of the program, I was creating professional level web applications and web sites. I have a strong foundation in all the technologies covered in that program, and I successfully completed all the assignments. There is so much more to learn and further develop my skills. I am eager to find out about working with you!</p>
		<p>I graduated from VCU in May 2017 with a Bachelor of Science, majoring in mechanical and nuclear engineering, with a minor in physics. So if you have trouble finding a developer who also knows about design of machinery or nuclear power plants, then take note! One of the most important things (in my opinion) that I got out of my engineering education is the principle that building anything has a design process. You shouldn't be worrying about the size of the bolts on a bicycle until you've designed the frame. Similar rules apply.</p>
